# IDCP
Departments of Cochin University of Science and Technology provide interdisciplinary electives as part of the curriculum alongside their courses. But there is no centralized automated system available until now to resolve the process. <b>Interdisciplinary Course Portal (IDCP)</b> is a web application which facilitates a centralized system to ease the complications regarding the paper-based unorganized approach to the problem.

Departments may contain options to verify and approve their students to the system and to notify regarding various information. Course coordinators will add and maintain course details, view and manage students enrolling from other departments to the courses provided. Faculty manage class activities including attendances, assignments and test grading. Students can register and enroll in electives provided by other departments and get notified about updates. Admin manages the overall system including the verification of department registrations.
